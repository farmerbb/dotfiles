Tools for remote sync and execution:

- Mainframer (general-purpose)
- Mirakle (Android-specific)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

- Make sure rsync is installed on both machines:

    sudo apt install rsync

- Make sure the remote machine has the local machine's public SSH key:

    # Local
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    # Remote
    echo "<contents of id_rsa.pub>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

- In the remote machine's ~/.bashrc file, comment out any logic for handling
  non-interactive shells, such as the following:

    # If not running interactively, don't do anything
    case $- in
        *i*) ;;
          *) return;;
    esac

- Make sure the local machine has an ~/.ssh/config file set up with the following:

    Host <name of host>
      User <name of user>
      HostName <ip address>
      Port <port number>
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      PreferredAuthentications publickey
      ControlMaster auto
      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
      ControlPersist 1h

Mainframer setup:

- Create a ~/.gitignore file with the following line:

    .mainframer

- Make sure this command has been run at least once:

    git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

- Create a .mainframer folder in your project directory
- Create a .mainframer/config file with the following line:

    remote_machine=<name of host>

- Create a .mainframer/ignore file containing file/folder paths to ignore (similar syntax to gitignore)
- Download Mainframer from https://github.com/buildfoundation/mainframer/releases/download/v2.1.0/mainframer.sh
- Place mainframer.sh somewhere in your PATH (for example, /usr/local/bin)
- Run the following command from the project directory:

    mainframer.sh "<remote command>"

- If no remote command is needed, simply execute:

    mainframer.sh true

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mirakle setup:

- Place the init.d folder inside of your ~/.gradle folder
- Create a ~/.gradle/init.d/mirakle_paths.txt file containing names of projects to build with Mirakle
- Do a Gradle build as normal. Mirakle will automatically build and run the app.
