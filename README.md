# dotfiles

This repo contains scripts, configuration, and documentation ("[dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/)") that I use as part of my day-to-day workflow.  They are made public in the hopes that others may find them useful in solving the same kinds of problems that I have solved for my various computing tasks.

I make no guarantees that the contents of this repo will be useful or even usable as-is.  They are specific to my configuration and hardware / software choices and may need some adaptation in order to work for your needs.  As such, no formal support will be given for the items in this repo.

Since this is a sanitized public mirror, certain strings (such as passwords, keys, etc) have been redacted.
